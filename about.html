			<p>
				Hi my name is Matthew Yamout and I am a Junior studying computer science at San Diego State University. Going into college
				I had a lot of questions that weren't generally answered in the classroom. Questions ranging from, how does one use github, 
				what is the best laptop for development, or how someone got an internship. Having been through two years of college and completing 
				a summer internship last summer I wanted to give back to my fellow incoming and current computer science majors. Hopefully this
				website serves as a decent guide to jumpstarting your computer science career!
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3><strong>Technical Experience</strong></h3>
			<p>
				During my summer internship I created a full-stack web application that is being
				used internally inside the company. I have experience in Java, Python 3, JavaScript (ES6), and HTML5/CSS3. 
				I am able to create full-stack applications using Python's flask framework and have experience in the Angular
				framework for JavaScript.
