			<p>
				Hi my name is Matthew Yamout and I am a Junior studying computer science at San Diego State University. Going into college
				I had a lot of questions that weren't generally answered in the classroom. Questions ranging from, how does one use github, 
				what is the best laptop for development, or how someone got an internship. Having been through two years of college and completing 
				a summer internship last summer I wanted to give back to my fellow incoming and current computer science majors. Hopefully this
				website serves as a decent guide to jumpstarting your computer science career!
			</p>

			<h3><strong>Technical Experience</strong></h3>
			<p>
				Currently I have a larger focus on improving my Front-End and Full-Stack development skills. Over the summer I created an internal full-stack web
				application using JavaScript (ES6) and the AngularJS framework. I have experience setting up full-stack web apps using Python's Flask framework. My most recent project utilizes the Mean (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack as I want to expand my knowledge to node and using the gulp build system. Besides front-end development I have a solid background in Java. I have completed a variety of projects using Java, with my latest project using multiple APIs through a maven build. I have a great desire to expand my knowledge and become the best software developer I can be!
