					The llama is a relative of the camel that calls the Andes Mountains home.
					Our great furry friends were domesticated by the native population in South America
					due to their ability to carry large loads of supplies while navigating the rocky mountain
					terrain. Llamas can carry up to 75 pounds whilst traveling 20 miles a day!

			<div class="col-md-4">

					Llamas are strictly herbivores, eating mainly grass. Like their camel cousins, llamas can survive 
					off of a large variety of plants and can go for long periods without water. These traits help them 
					adapt to the mountain environment they live in.

			<div class="col-md-4">

					Despite being domesticated as a mode of transporting goods, llamas are most certainly not all work and 
					no play! Llamas have been known to refuse to move if the load on their backs is too heavy!

					<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>
					Hi! My name is Matthew Yamout and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at 
					San Diego State University. So far in school I have completed courses in: Data Structures/Algorithms, Programming Languages(mainly functional), and the university's Java courses. Recently last semester I took a position inside the Computer Science Department as a teaching assistant for the introduction and intermediate
					Java courses where I assist students inside our university's computer lab. I do by helping develop professional coding practices through mentoring and code walkthroughs. As I enter my junior year of school I'm excited for all of the opprotunities the new year brings along with the chances I'll have to grow as a computer scientist and programmer!

					<h3><strong>Outside Of School</strong></h3>
					Born and raised in sunny San Diego, I guess you could classify me as the sterotypical Californian. After classes you can catch me at the beach snacking on a California burrito. Unfortunately I do not "shred the gnar", as my friends last summer in New York put it, as my surfing capabilities are somewhat to be desired however I do enjoy swimming in the water and body surfing some of waves every now and then. When I'm not at the beach I can usually be found at my desk or in the library abusing my headphones to the latest EDM track while I'm working on homework or coding up a small project of some sort.

					<h3><strong>Design Aspects Of Challenge Website</strong></h3>
					As per the request of the challenge I ultilized the Bootstrap framework to make the site responsive for devices of any screen size. Using Bootstrap also gave me access to many preset CSS classes which made formatting and making the website look pretty a snap! Lastly I wanted to make a single-page website and Bootstrap allowed me to do that very quickly. The JavaScript aspect of the page is used for the "Which Llama Are You?" game. Inside the JavaScript file the code is quick and simple, taking the user input and then displaying the correct picture, bio, and user given name of the llama. I chose to use the AngularJS as the framework is perfect for single-page websites. The two way data-binding allowed me to easily develop the llama game, along with hiding all of the llama pictures and only showing the correct one.

					I'm excited to be a Front-End Developer right now as the web is going through some major changes as it solidifies itself as the number one place to do commercial buisness. In this day and age a well designed and responsive website is much more appealing than having to drive and or walk into a retail store to purchase the same good. Web-apps are also gaining so so much leway as cloud based applications are pushing to become the future. There is so much change going on right now on the web and I cannot wait to be at the forefront of it!
