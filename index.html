						The llama is a relative of the camel that calls the Andes Mountains home.
						Our great furry friends were domesticated by the native population in South America
						due to their ability to carry large loads of supplies while navigating the rocky mountain
						terrain. Llamas can carry up to 75 pounds whilst traveling 20 miles a day!

						Llamas are strictly herbivores, eating mainly grass. Like their camel cousins, llamas can survive 
						off of a large variety of plants and can go for long periods without water. These traits help them 
						adapt to the mountain environment they live in.

						Despite being domesticated as a mode of transporting goods, llamas are most certainly not all work and 
						no play! Llamas have been known to refuse to move if the load on their backs is too heavy! If unhappy with their workload they will simply flop on the ground and lay there until the load is lightened. Make sure you treat your llama right as they helped pave the way for the great South American civilizations. Llama power has indeed moved mountains!

						<h3>Llamas can run up to 35 mph</h3>
							Though it may not look like it at first,
							llamas can run extremely quickly! It's been
							theorized that our furry friends lie in wait and 
							unleash their speed when the time is right. Video
							evidence has been collected of llamas doing practice runs.

						<h3>The scientific name for llama is Llama glama</h3>
						This fact may shed some light on the name of website, but yes
						the scientific classification for llama is Llama glama!	As the name may suggest all llamas are indeed glamorous. When alone most llamas are busy working on their hairstyles between bites of grass!

						<h3>Humming is a common way llamas communicate with one another</h3>
						Llamas are great musicians: it may seem as the most popular way they "talk" 
						to each other is through humming. Watch out, that next big hit might just feature a llama!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>
						<h3>Llamas are very intelligent and can be trained</h3>
						What's that? Llamas can be trained? Move over Fido because man just found a new best friend.
						Llamas are extremely smart and are able to learn things quickly as well as communicate effectively with each other in the herd. Our majestic friend is the perfect sidekick to have by your side when you are trying to survive the latest robot uprising. Imagine trekking across the land on your own llama combating robots in epic battles and ripping out circuit boards. Hmm SciFi should pick this up...Or Adult Swim that would work too.

						<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>
						Hi! My name is Matthew Yamout and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at 
						San Diego State University. So far in school I have completed courses in: Data Structures/Algorithms, Programming Languages(mainly functional), and the university's Java courses. Last semester I took a position in the Computer Science Department as a teaching assistant for the introduction and intermediate
						Java courses where I assist students inside our university's computer lab. I am able to help my peers by developing professional coding practices through mentoring and code walkthroughs. As I enter my junior year of school I'm excited for all of the opportunities the new year brings along with the chances I'll have to grow as a computer scientist and programmer!

						<h3><strong>Outside Of School</strong></h3>
						Born and raised in sunny San Diego, I guess you could classify me as the stereotypical Californian. After classes you can catch me at the beach snacking on a California burrito. Unfortunately I do not "shred the gnar", as my friends last summer in New York put it, as my surfing capabilities are not up to par for gnar shredding. Living in San Diego still love the beach, my favorite activities being swimming in the water and body surfing some of waves every now and then. When I'm not at the beach I can usually be found at my desk or in the library with my headphones on listening to the latest EDM track while I'm working on homework or coding up a small project of some sort.

						<h3><strong>Design Aspects Of Challenge Website</strong></h3>
						As per the request of the challenge I utilized the Bootstrap framework to make the site responsive for devices of any screen size. Using Bootstrap also gave me access to many preset CSS classes which made formatting and making the website look pretty a snap! Lastly I wanted to make a single-page website and Bootstrap allowed me to do that very quickly. The JavaScript aspect of the page is used for the "Adopt A Llama" game. Inside the JavaScript file the code is quick and simple, taking the user input and then displaying the correct picture, bio, and user given name of the llama. I chose to use the AngularJS framework as it's perfect for single-page websites. The two way data-binding allowed me to easily develop the adoption process.

						I'm excited to be a Front-End Developer right now as the web is going through some major changes as it solidifies itself as the number one place to do commercial business. In this day and age a well designed and responsive website is much more appealing than having to drive and or walk into a retail store to purchase the same good. Web-apps are also gaining so so much leeway as cloud based applications are pushing to become the future. There is so much change going on right now on the web and I cannot wait to be at the forefront of it!
