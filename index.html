					The llama is a relative of the camel that calls the Andes Mountains home.
					Our great furry friends were domesticated by the native population in South America
					due to their ability to carry large loads of supplies while navigating the rocky mountain
					terrain. Llamas can carry up to 75 pounds whilst traveling 20 miles a day!

					Llamas are strictly herbivores, eating mainly grass. Like their camel cousins, llamas can survive 
					off of a large variety of plants and can go for long periods without water. These traits help them 
					adapt to the mountain environment they live in.

					Despite being domesticated as a mode of transporting goods, llamas are most certainly not all work and 
					no play! Llamas have been known to refuse to move if the load on their backs is too heavy! If unhappy with their work load they will simply flop on the ground and lay there until the load is lightened. Make sure you treat your llama right as they helped pave the way for the great South American civilizations. Llama power has indeed moved mountains!

						<h3>Llamas can run up to 35 mph</h3>
						Though it may not look like it at first,
						llamas can run extremely quickly! Its been
						theorized that our furry friends lie in wait and 
						unlease their speed when the time is right. Video
						evidence has been collected of llamas doing practice runs.

						<h3>The scientific name for llama is Llama glama</h3>
						This fact may shed some light on the name of website, but yes
						the scientific classification name for llamas is Llama glama!

						<h3>Humming is a common way llamas communicate with one another</h3>
						Llamas are great musicians it may seem as the most popular way they "talk" 
						to each other is through humming. Watch out, that next big hit might just feature a llama!

						<h3>Llamas are very intelligent and can be trained</h3>
						What's that? Llamas can be trained? Move over fido because man just found a new best friend.
						Llamas are extremely smart and are able to learn things quickly as well as communicate effectively with
						eat other in the herd. Just the perfect side kick to have by your side when you are trying to survive
						the robot latest robot uprising. Imagine treking across the land on your own llama combating robots in epic battles and ripping out circuit boards. Hmm SciFi should pick this up...Or Adult Swim that would work too.

					<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>
					Hi! My name is Matthew Yamout and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at 
					San Diego State University. So far in school I have completed courses in: Data Structures/Algorithms, Programming Languages(mainly functional), and the university's Java courses. Recently last semester I took a position inside the Computer Science Department as a teaching assistant for the introduction and intermediate
					Java courses where I assist students inside our university's computer lab. I do by helping develop professional coding practices through mentoring and code walkthroughs. As I enter my junior year of school I'm excited for all of the opprotunities the new year brings along with the chances I'll have to grow as a computer scientist and programmer!

					<h3><strong>Outside Of School</strong></h3>
					Born and raised in sunny San Diego, I guess you could classify me as the sterotypical Californian. After classes you can catch me at the beach snacking on a California burrito. Unfortunately I do not "shred the gnar", as my friends last summer in New York put it, as my surfing capabilities are somewhat to be desired however I do enjoy swimming in the water and body surfing some of waves every now and then. When I'm not at the beach I can usually be found at my desk or in the library abusing my headphones to the latest EDM track while I'm working on homework or coding up a small project of some sort.

					<h3><strong>Design Aspects Of Challenge Website</strong></h3>
					As per the request of the challenge I ultilized the Bootstrap framework to make the site responsive for devices of any screen size. Using Bootstrap also gave me access to many preset CSS classes which made formatting and making the website look pretty a snap! Lastly I wanted to make a single-page website and Bootstrap allowed me to do that very quickly. The JavaScript aspect of the page is used for the "Which Llama Are You?" game. Inside the JavaScript file the code is quick and simple, taking the user input and then displaying the correct picture, bio, and user given name of the llama. I chose to use the AngularJS as the framework is perfect for single-page websites. The two way data-binding allowed me to easily develop the llama game, along with hiding all of the llama pictures and only showing the correct one.

					I'm excited to be a Front-End Developer right now as the web is going through some major changes as it solidifies itself as the number one place to do commercial buisness. In this day and age a well designed and responsive website is much more appealing than having to drive and or walk into a retail store to purchase the same good. Web-apps are also gaining so so much leway as cloud based applications are pushing to become the future. There is so much change going on right now on the web and I cannot wait to be at the forefront of it!
