				<h2>Setting Up A Bash Terminal On Windows 10</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-12">
				<h3 class="indent"><strong>Intro</strong></h3>
					<p class="indent">
						Having a bash terminal is why many software developers choose OS X or some
						flavor of Linux, like Ubuntu, to use as their main software development machine.
						A bash terminal allows for the use of package managers, easily navigating system,
						files, and is used greatly in full-stack development when testing servers before
						deploying the code into production. Windows has always lacked a bash terminal simply
						because Windows is not Unix based. However, now on the latest update of Windows 10
						Microsoft was added the ability to enable a bash terminal for users to use. Learning
						how to use a bash terminal is a very useful skill in development and will give you
						a major leg up in the job market. Since most tutorials on this site will take advantage
						of the bash terminal I would like to go ahead and help anyone following along on a 
						Windows machine setup the Windows Linux Subsystem. If you are using a Mac you already
						have a bash terminal on your machine and if you are using a flavor of Linux then you
						probably already know how to use the terminal!

					<h3 class="indent"><strong>Updating To Windows 10</strong></h3>
					<p class="indent">
						Firstly we need to update to the latest version of Windows 10, the Anniversary Update.
						To check if you need to update in the Cortana search bar along the bottom left of the taskbar
						search "updates" and then click on the first app to show up. Now at the top of the page if
						it says something along the lines of "your system is up to date" you are good to go! If there
						is a system update waiting for you, the Anniversary Update's code is 1607, then update and
						resart your computer.

					<h3 class="indent"><strong>Enabling Windows Subsystem For Linux</strong></h3>
					<p class="indent">
						Now we need to enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux. To do this in the 
						search bar again type in "features" and click on the first link. Scroll
						down to the bottom and when you see "Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta)"
						check the box and press ok. Windows will prompt you with a resart. Resart your
						computer and we are almost there!

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h3 class="indent"><strong>Downloading And Installing Bash Terminal</strong></h3>
					<p class="indent">
						Finally we are going to search again "cmd" and click the first app to appear.
						What we have opened is the Command Prompt, the Windows version of terminal.
						In the window type in bash and hit enter. Windows will now install a bash 
						terminal on your machine, just follow the instructions given to you during
						the download. There are a lot of tutorials out there to help you pick up
						the terminal commands, however I will just be covering the ones that are
						necessary when needed. I do recommend the first command to run is
						"sudo apt update" to update your terminal. To open your terminal again
						search "bash" in the search bar and open the first app to appear. I also
						recommend to pin this to your task bar as you will be using it a lot!

				<h2>Getting Started With GitHub and Git</h2>

				<h3><strong>Intro</strong></h3>
				<p class="indent">
					Github is a website software developers use to share and work on code with each other.
					Github is the most popular tool to host open-source projects for the computer science
					community and is also the best source control tool as well. Github allows a code base to
					be shared across an entire team of developers and gives each programmer the opprotunity
					to be working on the project simultaneously. With each new commit to the Github repository
					the team will be able to see exactly what their fellow team memember changed. How is this
					possible? With Git of course! So on that note lets get started...

				<h2>Intro To Basic Full-Stack Development And The Flask Framework</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p class="indent">
						Great full-stack developers are almost always in high demand and it's extremely easy to
						get into. Full-stack development refers to the two main components of web based applications,
						which are the backend and the frontend of the website. In a quick summary the frontend is 
						what your user interacts with. For example, say you were browsing Kayak.com for flights to
						Hawaii. The frontend would consist of the calender you use to create your trip window, choose
						between flights, and enter in your payment information. The backend on the other hand is what
						happens behind the scenes. Using the same example the backend is what handles your flight reservation
						and stores the information in a database for the airline company. The backend of a web application
						usually also hosts the frontend html, css, and javascript files. There are many popular backend frameworks
						like Java Spring framework or simply put Node.js, however in this tutorial we will be using the Python
						Flask framework. Flask is very simple to use and after this guide you should be able to have websites
						up and running in no time!

				<h2>Setting Up Your Development Environments</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p class="indent">
						A programmer's best tool would easily be their integrated development environments, or IDEs.
						IDEs have the capability to handle and complie multiple languages along with increasing
						overall productivity through debugging tools and integrated build tools and git support.
						Personally, I reccommend using IDEs when developing languages like Java, Scala, or C/C++.
						With Java being the most popular language taught in universities this tutorial will be
						focused on getting you up and running Java. On a side note you can find plug-ins to
						support C/C++ development in an IDE, but the IDE we will be setting up here natively
						supports Scala and Java. So lets get started with setting up Intellij!
