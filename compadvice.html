		<h1>What's The Best Computer For Computer Science?</h1>

			<h3 class="indent"><strong>Intro: Does the computer really matter?</strong></h3>
			<p class="indent">
				A computer is a computer scientist's greatest weapon. With it one has to power to create ground-breaking code. Computer scientists are at the forefront of change around the world and with the right computer anything is possible.

			<h3 class="indent"><strong>Operating Systems</strong></h3>
			<p class="indent">
				When selecting a computer for college, computer scientists generally mull over the two main stream operating systems, Windows or Mac OS. As I have experience with using both for software development, I can personally say that both operating systems are great. In the end it all comes down to personal preference and what you want out of the machine. Though that answer may not seem all that helpful, you won't truly know which one is best for you until you go out and try each one. In this section however, I will focus on dicussing both operating systems in terms of software development and the pros/cons of each system. The look and feel of the OS ultimately will come down to you, but there are little quirks that both have when writing code.
				<br>
				<h3 class="indent"><strong>Windows 10</strong></h3>
				First off we'll talk about Windows 10. Recently I switched from my Mac to a Windows machine and haven't looked back yet. With the latest update of Windows 10 Microsoft added the ability to use a bash shell directly on Windows, something that we have never seen before. The shell allows users to use Git, Python, Ruby, Node.js, and even build systems like npm and gulp. As Apple's ecosystem seems to become more and more closed each year I was looking to make the jump to Windows and the fact that there is a bash shell now makes all developer's lives easier. Now the terminal is still in beta, however it works extremely well, I have yet to discover any problems with it and Microsoft is quick to roll out updates. Besides the new bash shell developing on Windows offers users the ability to work with Microsoft only technologies. These languages range from C# to .NET to setting up Azure web servers. Generally Windows machines are also cheaper than the laptops that Apple offers so if you are in the market for a budget computer look no further than here.
				<br>
				<h3 class="indent"><strong>Mac OS</strong></h3>
				The other alternative is Mac OS. Mac OS offers the convience of being built on top of Unix, meaning there is already a bash terminal built in, no need to monkey around in the settings to enable it. This also means that the terminal is not a beta program, it's fully operational and works flawlessly. A lot of students choose Macs simply because they are considered the best OS to develop on. A year ago I would have agreed with that statement, however now that Windows 10 has that bash shell I would say now it comes down to personal preference. The one thing that Mac OS offers is the ability to develop iOS apps. You can only develop iOS apps on a Mac, however you can also develop Android apps on it as well. So if you see yourself creating a lot of apps for the phone I'd recommend getting a Mac due to the ability to write apps for both iOS and Android. If you are doing anything else however, both operating systems will do just fine and it truly does come down to personal preference and budget.

			<h3 class="indent"><strong>Intro: Lets Talk Specs</strong></h3>
			<p class="indent">
				In addition to the operating system you are going to need a computer with some decent specs for all of your programming needs. Now unlike main stream belief you don't need the latest and greatest specs to write computer programs. Lets go indepth about what you should be looking for in your next computer!
				<br>
				<h3 class="indent"><strong>CPU</strong></h3>
				Out of all the specs you need the CPU is the most important. It will handle all of the compiling and running of the programs you write. The slower the processor, the longer the compile times and amount of time it takes your program to run. Personally I'd look for something with an Intel i5 CPU. An i7 costs to much money usually and is overkill for the programs you'd be writing during your time in college. On the flip side a Core M or an i3 is going to be a little to slow and won't scale to well with future updates on your machine. Most Windows laptops come with Intel i5s as well as all the MacBook Pros and Airs.
				<br>
				<h3 class="indent"><strong>RAM/Memory</strong></h3>
				This one is short and sweet. When looking at computers don't get anything under 8GB of ram, especially if you are thinking about picking up a Windows machine. Don't fret though 8GB of ram is the standard nowadays and you'd be hard pressed to find a laptop that comes with less. However, don't go bargain hunting and get something with only 4GB because in the end you'll wish you spent a little extra for the eight.
				<br>
				<h3 class="indent"><strong>Hard Drive</strong></h3>
				This one is pretty simple, but I thought I'd mention it. When searching for a new computer try and get something with a Solid State Drive, or SSD. These will give you faster load times and less chances of failure. When it comes to size I'd recommend a 256GB SSD. 128GB I feel would be cutting to close after one or two years so the extra space will provide a nice cushion.

			<h3 class="indent"><strong>Wrap Up</strong></h3>
			<p class="indent">
				So as you can see in the end a lot of this comes down to personal preference. If you follow the suggested specs when looking for your next computer then you shouldn't go wrong and your machine will indeed last you until the end of college, quite possibly long after as well.
