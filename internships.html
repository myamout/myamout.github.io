				<h3><strong>Intro: Why Are Internships Important For Computer Science Majors?</strong></h3>
				<p>
					We are at a point in time were the computer science and software development industry is absolutely booming. Companies love interns and treat them as full-time employees. This is important for companies as in the long run it's more cost effective to hire their level one employees through internship conversions. What makes internships fantastic for students as well is the fact that almost all of the intern programs companies put on are during the summer break. This means that students can work hard for their degree and spend the summer gaining invaluable industry experience. Internships also give students the ability to travel to knew cities and states! A lot of the larger companies like: Google, FaceBook, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, etc will provide housing (in the form of a stipended or subsidized housing) and cover all costs of travel. For example, I got to travel to New York City and spent the entire summer working and living in Downtown Manhattan. Internships offer students the chance to make memories and learn valuable industry knowledge that will give them a leg up in the post grad job hunt. So how does one get an internship? I will use my past experience to make a guide and help you get a head start!

				<h3><strong>Your Resume</strong></h3>
				<p>
					Your resume is the obvious starting point. Without a clean, well drafted resume getting your foot in the door will be extremely difficult. Recruiters will be flooded with resumes during internship season, therefore to be able to view all of the candidates on average most recruiters will spend all of a minute tops on your's. Therefore it's very important to keep your resume to exactly one page. Now what do you put onto your resume? At the very top the recruiter should see your name, email, phone number, and your address. Either keep this centered to either the left side or middle of the page. Now below this you're going to want to have these four sections: education, work experience, personal projects, and a list of the technologies that you are familiar with. One quick side note everything on your resume is fair game in an interview so only put languages or technologies on your resume that you are comfortable with! Okay so under education you need to list your college/university, major, expected graduation date and your most recent gpa. Regarding your gpa, it's common practice to only add your gpa to your resume if it's 3.00 or higher. Work history is fairly explanatory, however the more technical experience in software development the better. If you don't have any, worry not as I had no software development experience when I interviewed for my internship. Personal projects are relatively for personal preference. If you don't have any work experience in software development then personal projects can make you stand out as they can be used as a real way to show off your skills. If you have ample technical experience then you can include one or two projects you've worked on. Lastly, list out any of the technologies that you are comfortable with. Don't list Microsoft Office as this is already assume. Here list out Java, Python, HTML5/CSS3, Node.js, etc. Common practice dictates that you order most knowledge of to least knowledge of in left to right format. And that's the resume! If you look over to the right I've attached a sample resume for you to take a gander at.
