				<h3><strong>Intro: Why Are Internships Important For Computer Science Majors?</strong></h3>
				<p>
					We are at a point in time were the computer science and software development industry is absolutely booming. Companies love interns and treat them as full-time employees. This is important for companies as in the long run it's more cost effective to hire their level one employees through internship conversions. What makes internships fantastic for students as well is the fact that almost all of the intern programs companies put on are during the summer break. This means that students can work hard for their degree and spend the summer gaining invaluable industry experience. Internships also give students the ability to travel to knew cities and states! A lot of the larger companies like: Google, FaceBook, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, etc will provide housing (in the form of a stipended or subsidized housing) and cover all costs of travel. For example, I got to travel to New York City and spent the entire summer working and living in Downtown Manhattan. Internships offer students the chance to make memories and learn valuable industry knowledge that will give them a leg up in the post grad job hunt. So how does one get an internship? I will use my past experience to make a guide and help you get a head start!

				<h3><strong>Your Resume</strong></h3>
				<p>
					Your resume is the obvious starting point. Without a clean, well drafted resume getting your foot in the door will be extremely difficult. Recruiters will be flooded with resumes during internship season, therefore to be able to view all of the candidates on average most recruiters will spend all of a minute tops on your's. Therefore it's very important to keep your resume to exactly one page. Now what do you put onto your resume? At the very top the recruiter should see your name, email, phone number, and your address. Either keep this centered to either the left side or middle of the page. Now below this you're going to want to have these four sections: education, work experience, personal projects, and a list of the technologies that you are familiar with. One quick side note everything on your resume is fair game in an interview so only put languages or technologies on your resume that you are comfortable with! Okay so under education you need to list your college/university, major, expected graduation date and your most recent gpa. Regarding your gpa, it's common practice to only add your gpa to your resume if it's 3.00 or higher. Work history is fairly explanatory, however the more technical experience in software development the better. If you don't have any, worry not as I had no software development experience when I interviewed for my internship. Personal projects are relatively for personal preference. If you don't have any work experience in software development then personal projects can make you stand out as they can be used as a real way to show off your skills. If you have ample technical experience then you can include one or two projects you've worked on. Lastly, list out any of the technologies that you are comfortable with. Don't list Microsoft Office as this is already assume. Here list out Java, Python, HTML5/CSS3, Node.js, etc. Common practice dictates that you order most knowledge of to least knowledge of in left to right format. And that's the resume! If you look over to the right I've attached a sample resume for you to take a gander at.

				<h3><strong>Applying</strong></h3>
				<p>
					So now that you have a killer resume all that's left is to apply! Well how does one do this? The easiest and most convient way is to simply apply online. All the major companies like: Facebook, Google, or Microsoft have very easy to use career pages where you can submit your application online. Not just the big comapnies either, many many small companies also offer the ability to apply online. When taking this route come internship season, generally starting in August and finishing in December, the best thing you can do is check if online applications are accepted though they most likely are. The second most popular way is to apply at a career fair. Career fairs are extremely popular due to the fact that the company's recruiters will be present giving you invaluable facetime with them. When passing off your resume at a career fair be yourself with the recruiter and they will most likely ask you questions based on your resume. The biggest advice that I can personally give for career fairs is to be yourself and not be shy. I know that it can be hard but realize that your fellow peers attending the career fair are as nervous as you, however generally applying via career fairs produce better results than applying online. Search your university's career services website for upcoming career fairs and what companies will be attending. Off to the right I'll leave a list of companies that are known for their internship programs.

				<h3><strong>The Interview Process</strong></h3>
				<p>
					You got an interview! This is fantastic news. Now how do you prepare for it? Well lets break this down into some steps...
					<br>
					<h3><strong>Studying</strong></h3>
					When it comes to studying the best advice I can give is know your resume from the front and back. Like I stated in the Resume section earlier everything on your resume is fair game so know everything on it. Also if you decided to include your Github on your resume there is a chance the company you applied to has taken a glance at it, therefore it's best to review any projects you have up there. In computer science interviews applicants are generally expected to be able to write code. Most of these questions will be based on ideas and topics covered in your university's data structure classes. I also suggest you pick up a copy of "Cracking the Coding Interview". This book has over a hundred and fifty questions to study from that a based on the questions you might get asked at an interview. This book is considered among the software development community as the holy grail of interview prep. Get this book.
					<br>
					<h3><strong>The Phone Interview/Hackerrank Challenge</strong></h3>
					Generally the first step is a phone interview, however recently many companies have been shifting towards using Hackerrank challenges as the first step. With the phone interview you most likely get questions about your resume and be asked a few warm-up coding questions. Some companies might give you harder challenges as well, however phone interviews are generally just to get to know you and determine if you are a culture fit for the company and that you can back up what you have listed on your resume. For the Hackerrank challenge you will recieve a link from the company and be tasked to complete usually between two to four coding exercises within a four day timeframe. Based on how the challenge goes and your solutions then you will be called in for an onsite interview. Same applies for the phone interview.
					<br>
					<h3><strong>The Onsite</strong></h3>
					For the onsite interview the company will have you come for an in-person interview. Don't worry if you live out-of-state as almost every company with a reputable internship program will pay for your flight and housing accomadations. Generally an onsite will take up most if not all of the day to complete. During this timeframe expected multiple coding interviews with questions much harder than the phone interview, a behavioral interview, and a networking session in some shape or form. Do well during the onsite and you should be expecting an offer! Early congradulations are in order!
