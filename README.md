This web page was created in response to the Front End Development Intern challenge given to me by Zappos. Project uses HTML5,
CSS3, JavaScript, Boostrap, and AngularJS 1.5.6. Special thanks to Pixabay.com for all of the free stock photos of llamas,
National Geographic for the llama facts, and Kids Play and Create for some addition fun llama facts!
